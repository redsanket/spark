==========
Query Bank
==========

This chapter contains commonly used queries and some advanced use cases for
your reference. We'll be adding more queries and possibly categorize 
the queries to help you better use Starling.

Setting Up 
==========

Before you can run the Hive queries or Pig scripts in the sections below,
you will need to do the 

- Get a Kerberos ticket: `$ `kinit {user_name}@Y.CORP.YAHOO.COM``
- Set the job queue to ``default``: ``$ set mapreduce.job.queuename=default``

Starling Permissions
--------------------

To execute many of the Starling queries and Pig scripts in this chapter, you need to be able to access the
Starling table ``starling_jobs_confs``. Only members of the group ``ygrid_group_gpd`` group, however,
have access to this table. If you do not have permission to the table, you will get the following error::

   Permission denied: user={your_user_name}, access=EXECUTE,


Unfortunately, we currently do not have a way to request membership to 
``ygrid_group_gpd``, but we are hoping to allow users to request membership
in the near future. 

Hive
====

Because some of the Hive queries will require more time to complete execution, we recommend that you
increase the timeout by following command: ``hive –hiveconf hive.metastore.client.socket.timeout=200``

Pig
===

To use Pig with Starling, you need to access the Starling Hive tables through HCatalog.
Thus, you will need to start Pig with the option `` -useHCatalog``.

Calculating the Total Job Completion Time
-----------------------------------------

Business owners of data pipelines, lead data SEs, segment owners,
capacity managers, and program managers all require different
completion times for grid activity that may involve a complex
set of jobs, data pipeplines, segments, applications, and 
products. A business owner of a data pipeline
might need data move through a pipeline on the grid in
under 3.5 hours, whereas, a lead data SE instead focuses
on the total time needed to execute an application.

Calculating the total job completion time may be complex because
it might involve tracing a job elonging to a segment that is part of a larger pipeline.
This pipeline could be part of an application that is, in turn,
part of a larger product. The L2 of the business unit will have
a SLA and utilization metrics for this product along with others. 

Given an start and end time in the simple figure below, how would you calculate the total actual 
time to compare with your expected time (SLA/required time)? 
The answers is with **tags**, which we'll look at next before 
showing how to use them.

Tags
#### 

Starling allows you to set different tags for different types
of information. Once tags have been set, YARN starts 
to log the tag values in the Job Tracker configurations.
You can then then estimate the total time for SLAs, 
capacity consumption for any product, intitiative, or BU
through the rolled-up tag values.

Using Tags With Hive
********************

By running the following script from the Hive CLI, you can
follow the MapReduce jobs that are spawned through
the ID ``10001``.

.. code-block:: sql

   set tagx_identifier_pipelineInstanceID=10001;

   set hive.metastore.client.socket.timeout = 20000;
   set mapred.job.queue.name=unfunded;

   use starling;

   desc starling_fs_blocks;

   select count(grid)
   from starling_fs_blocks 
   where grid = 'CB' 
   and dt = '2014_07_01';

You can also run a Hive script and specify the tag with the CLI::

    hive -hiveconf tagx_identifier_pipelineInstanceID=10001 -f test.sql

Using Tags With Pig/MapReduce
*****************************


For MapReduce, you need to specify the tag from the command line. 
For example, the option ``-D`` is used to specify the tag ID ``10001`` below::

    yarn jar X.jar pi -Dmapred.job.queue.name=unfunded -Dtagx_identifier_pipelineInstanceID=10001 16 1000

Pig, like Hive, allows you to specifiy the tag in a script or from the command line::

    pig -P param_file params.txt script1-hadoop.pig

You can also set the tag in Oozie through ``workflow.xml``:

.. code-block:: xml

   <property><name>tagx_identifier_jobInstanceId</name><value>100001</value></property>


Estimating Capacity Cost 
------------------------

In this example, we'll be using Starling queries to calculate the capacity 
cost per month for both storage and computation. In this example,
we'll be calculating the `total cost of ownership (TCO) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership>`_ that factors in the following elements:

- **network bandwidth** - data transferred into and out of clusters for all colos, 
  including cross-colo transfers.
- **operations engineering** - head count for service engineering and data operations
  teams responsible for day-to-day operations and support.
- **acquisition/install (one time)** - labor, POs, transportation, space, support, upgrades,
  decommisions, shipping, receiving, etc.
- **network hardware** - aggregated network component costs, including switches, wiring,
  terminal servers, power strips, etc.
- **active use and operations (recurring)** - recurring datacenter operation costs (power, 
  space, labor support, and facility maintenance).
- **R&D head count** - the head count for platform software development, quality, and
  release engineering.
- **cluster hardware** - data nodes, name nodes, job trackers, gateways, load proxies,
  monitoring, aggregator, and Web servers.


Storage Consumption
###################

Storage is generally priced as the TCO for a GB per month and can be measured as data stored or raw HDFS
used. For Hadoop as a Service at Yahoo, the storage cost is $0.0087  for each GB per month for raw
HDFS (accounts for three times your data stored on HDFS for replication factor at Yahoo). 

The query below will return the monthly average consumption of data and raw HDFS in GB.
(Replace values in ``<>`` with your own values.)

.. code-block:: mysql

   SELECT Avg(data_gb), 
          Avg(hdfs_gb) 
   FROM   (SELECT dt, 
                  Sum(size) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024     data_GB, 
                  Sum(size) * 3 / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 HDFS_GB 
           FROM   starling_fs_entries 
           WHERE  path LIKE '/projects/<project_name>/%' 
                  AND grid = '<grid_name>' 
                  AND dt BETWEEN '<YYYY_MM_01>' AND '<YYYY_MM_30>' 
           GROUP  BY dt) daily_GB; 


Compute Consumption
###################

The computation is priced in dollars for each GB-Hour within a month and can be measured as the
number of map and reduce memory containers consumed and the time those containers were
running. For Hadoop as a Service at Yahoo, the compute TCO is $0.0067 per GB-Hour per month.


In the starling query below, the field ``jobmemory.gb_hr`` can be directly multiplied with our unit compute TCO to arrive at total
compute cost for a given user and queue combination. 


.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT
      starling_job_summary.user,
      starling_job_summary.queue,
      SUM  (jobmemory.gb_hr)  
   FROM
      (  SELECT
         job_id,
         SUM(memory_mb_sec)/1024/60/60  gb_hr  
      FROM
         (  SELECT
            starling_job_confs.job_id,
            starling_tasks.task_id,
            IF(starling_tasks.type='MAP',
            (starling_job_confs.params['mapreduce.map.memory.mb']*(  starling_tasks.run_time/1000)),
            (starling_job_confs.params['mapreduce.reduce.memory.mb']*(starling_tasks.run_time/10  00)))  AS  memory_mb_sec  
         FROM
            starling_job_confs  
         JOIN
            starling_tasks  
               on  starling_job_confs.job_id  =  starling_tasks.job_id  
         WHERE
            starling_job_confs.dt  BETWEEN  '<YYYY_MM_01>'  and  '<YYYY_MM_30>'  
            AND  starling_job_confs.grid  IN  (
               '<grid_name>'
            )  
            AND  starling_tasks.dt  BETWEEN  '<YYYY_MM_01>'  and  '<YYYY_MM_30>'  
            AND  starling_tasks.grid  IN  (
               '<grid_name>'
            ))  all_tasks  
      GROUP  BY
         job_id  )  jobmemory  
      JOIN
         starling_job_summary  
            ON  jobmemory.job_id  =  starling_job_summary.job_id  
      WHERE
         starling_job_summary.dt  BETWEEN  '<YYYY_MM_01>'  and  '<YYYY_MM_30>'  
         AND  starling_job_summary.grid  ='<grid_name>'  
         AND  starling_job_summary.user  =  '<user_name>'  
      GROUP  BY
         starling_job_summary.user,
         starling_job_summary.queue;
