Introduction
============

Starling runs on the Axonite Blue (AB) cluster and uses the `HCatalog <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HCatalog>`_
server to  store the meta-data about its tables and the HDFS on this cluster to store all the
data. The tables used by Starling are stored in the ``starling`` database and have
the ``starling_`` prefix in their names.

Accessing Starling
------------------

Because Starling uses HCatalog, you can use Hive, Pig, or even the MapReduce Java API
to access data.

.. note:: The HCatalog server on AB is secured: it has the URI
          ``thrift://axoniteblue-hcat.ygrid.vip.gq1.yahoo.com:50513``
          and uses the Kerberos principal ``hcat/_HOST@YGRID.YAHOO.COM``.

Prerequisites
=============

- `On-Board to Axonite Blue <onboard><http://yo/grid-onboarding-howto>`_.
- Log onto Axonite Blue.

Querying Data
=============

Using Hive
----------

#. Request a Kerberos ticket: ``$ kinit {your_username}@Y.CORP.YAHOO.COM``
#. Start Hive: ``$ hive``
#. Set the queue that you're going to use. We'll use ``default`` for this tutorial::

       hive> SET mapred.job.queue.name=default;

   .. note:: To avoid having to set the queue manually, you can set the queue in the
             Hive configuration file ``$HOME/.hiverc``.
             Hive will use the queue set in the configuration file. You can use see a list
             of queues that you have
             access to by running the following: ``mapred queue -showacls``

#. Use the ``starling`` database: ``hive> use starling;``
#. Run a query against the ``starling_jobs`` table::

       hive> SELECT * FROM starling_jobs WHERE grid='AB' and dt='2018_05_03' LIMIT 10;

   .. note:: Unless you know what you're doing, always use the partition keys in your
             query (e.g., ``grid`` and ``dt``).
             If you don't, your hive ``sessionA`` will say ``"Error in semantic analysis:
             org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException: java.net.SocketTimeoutException:
             Read timed out"``, and you will need to restart your Hive client (all other Hive
             queries issued in that session will fail.)

#. Check out the other tables in the ``starling`` database: ``hive> show tables;``
#. As you do need to specify a partition, it's good to also see the list of available partitions: ``hive> SHOW PARTITIONS starling_jobs;``


Using Pig
---------

Pig can be used to work with tables on HCatalog. See the `HCatalog Getting Started <https://archives.ouroath.com/twiki/twiki.corp.yahoo.com/view/Grid/HCatalogGettingStarted.html#Pig>`_
on how to invoke Pig to use HCatalog. You have to specify your MapReduce Job queue
using the command-line option ``-Dmapred.job.queue.name=default`` (replace ``default``
with the queue you normally use to execute your MapReduce Jobs on AB).

You can then query the Starling tables in the following way::

    grunt> A = LOAD 'starling.starling_jobs' USING org.apache.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();
    grunt> B = LIMIT A 10;
    grunt> DUMP B;
    [...]

Getting Information About Starling
----------------------------------

From Hive, you can run queries to get basic information:

- Tables: ``show tables;``
- Partitions: ``show partitions starling_jobs;``
- Number of jobs run by a user: ``SELECT COUNT(job_id) FROM starling_jobs WHERE user='dfsload' and grid='MG' and dt='2011_12_03';``
- Number of jobs run each day: ``SELECT COUNT(1), dt FROM starling_jobs WHERE grid='MB' and dt>='2011_07_11' and dt <= '2011_07_13' GROUP BY dt;``


Next Step
=========

See the `Query Bank <../query_bank>`_ for examples of queries of Starling data.
