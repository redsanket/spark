*********************
New-Members Checklist
*********************

Account Access
==============

Verify ubkey is working
-----------------------

Next step is to verify that your ``ubkey`` is working:

  -  Open terminal
  -  type the following command ``yinit``
  -  you should see prompt message asking you to enter the pin. Use The
     default pin in the output message.
  -  When Asked for ``PKCS-11``: enter the same default key once more.
  -  If asked ``YubiKey for:``, touch and hold the ubkey until the key is
     generated.
  -  Enter your Unix password (the Bouncer password) when you are asked
     for the password.


The previous process should look like the following:


  .. code-block:: bash

    yinit
    Please enter your PIN code for YubiKey when prompted.
    2019/01/30 10:40:33 (Default PIN code for YubiKey is XXXXXX)
    Enter PIN: <ENTER_DEFAULT_PIN=123456>
    2019/01/30 10:40:48 [INFO] Generating new touchless key in hardware......
    2019/01/30 10:40:49 [INFO] Generating new emergency key in hardware......
    Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: <ENTER_DEFAULT_PIN
    Card added: /Library/OpenSC/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so
    YubiKey for: <TOUCH_UBKEY>
    Password: <OKTA_PASSSWORD>


A typical day to day ``ybkey`` operation would look like this:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ yinit
    Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: <DEFAULT>
    Card added: /Library/OpenSC/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so
    2019/01/31 09:59:01 Refreshing your credentials...
    YubiKey for `djohn`: <TOUCH_YBKEY>
    Password: <UNIX_PASSWORD_AKA_BOUNCER>
    Touch YubiKey: <TOUCH_YBKEY>
    2019/01/31 09:59:20 SSHCA credentials loaded into your ssh-agent.

**Troubleshooting**

If you have any problems initializing your ssh key:

#. First, Contact Sean
#. Reset bouncer password using the following link `http://yo/pw <http://yo/pw>`_
#. Use yo/ubkey to register your ubkey
