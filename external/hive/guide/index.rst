Hive User Guide 
===============

This guide is intended to help Yahoos use `Hive <http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/hive/>`_ 
at work. It's not intended to be a comprehensive guide for Hive, but a supplement to
the external `Apache Hive wiki <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Home>`_. 
Thus, the scope of this documentation is limited to Hive within a Yahoo environment.
