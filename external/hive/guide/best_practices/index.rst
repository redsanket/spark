Best Practices
==============

This chapter offers suggestions for using Hive for both content producers and consumers.

Data Producers
==============

- Always create tables in a database.
- When getting raw data from an initial loading or output of a MapReduce job, create an 
  external table for staging that can be used to load an optimized table.
- Don’t place data for external tables in the database directory.
- Carefully choose the format for storming.

  - **Text** – slow to read and write, compressed files cannot be split, may lead to huge maps.
  - **RCFile** – columns stored as binary blobs, default blocks of 4 MB, only the needed columns read. 
  - **Avro IDL** – full row read by consumers of data.
  - **ORC** – uses type specific encoders, stores statistics, index for skipping rows, and larger blocks (small reads).
- Limit the number of partition: 1000 partitions is much faster than 10000. Nested 
  partitions are almost always wrong (pressure on NameNode and HCatalog).
- Compress your data.
- Use GDM for data replication and retention management.
- Heavily comment your table definition and schema elements that allows the use of a data discovery tool.
- Append (rather than insert) new columns.
- Mark tables with skewed columns as skewed for efficient querying.
- Use ``SORT BY`` while storing data for better compression with ORCFile.
- Lay out related tables the same way, partition, and sort order.
- Partition data along natural query boundaries (e.g., date).
- Minimize data shuffle by collocating the most commonly joined data.
- Use RCFile with compression to save storage and to improve performance

Data Consumers
==============

- Use partition filter on partitioned tables.
- Understand the `differences between SORT BY and ORDER BY <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+SortBy#LanguageManualSortBy-DifferencebetweenSortByandOrderBy>`_. 
- Use skew join for skewed data.
- Avoid	``CROSS`` joins.
- Filter out ``NULL`` values for inner joins.
- Use default parallel execution of Hive.
- **UDFs** – you need to figure out if something special needs to be done for distributable UDAFs.
- Add frequently used commands in ``$HOME/.hiverc``. For example: ``SET mapred.job.queue.name=unfunded`` 
- Use ``EXPLAIN`` to analyze a query (before executing it).
- Verify the query plan to ensure a single scan through largest table.
- Check the query plan to ensure partition pruning is happening.
- Use at least one ``ON`` clause in every ``JOIN``.
- Tune ``io.sort.mb`` to avoid spilling.
- Tune ``mapred.max.split.size`` and ``mapred.min.split.size`` to ensure a single mapper wave.
- Tune ``mapred.reduce.tasks`` to an appropriate value based on the map output.
- Give extra memory for map joins like broadcast joins.
- Tune ORC parameters for better read performance.
