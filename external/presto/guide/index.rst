About This Guide
****************
This guide is intended to help folks at Verizon Media and Verizon use `Presto <http://prestodb.github.io/>`_ at work to query data on ygrid and VCG hadoop clusters. It's not intended to be a comprehensive guide for Presto, but a supplement to the external `Presto documentation <https://prestodb.github.io/docs/0.204/>`_. The scope of this documentation is limited to Presto within our internal environment. This document is **Verizon Media Proprietary/Confidential** and the contents of this document should not be released outside the company.
