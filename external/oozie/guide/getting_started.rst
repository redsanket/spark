Getting Started
===============

In the quick starts in this chapter, you will 
learn how to create Oozie Workflows, Coordinators, and
Bundles. Each quick start will have you 
do the following:

#. Create a simple grid applications with Oozie configuration
files (``workflow.xml``, ``coordinator.xml``, and ``bundle.xml``). 
We'll also be using the ``job.properties`` file to pass
values to parameterized Workflow

Prerequisites
-------------

- Complete the :ref:`On-boarding <onboard>`.


Upload workflow application directory to HDFS
workflow.xml / coordinator.xml / bundle.xml
‘lib’ directory for custom JARs and/or native code
