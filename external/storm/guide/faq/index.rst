Q: Why am I seeing "Connection reset by peer" errors and "Connection refused" messages?
###########################################################################################

The messages usually take the following form::

    2018-11-09 18:04:07.408 b.s.m.n.Client client-boss-1 [ERROR] connection attempt 8 to Netty-Client-{HOST}/{IP}:{PORT}  failed: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: {HOST}/{IP}:{PORT} 
    or
    2018-11-09 15:10:11.462 b.s.m.n.StormClientHandler client-worker-1 [INFO] Connection to {HOST}/{IP}:{PORT} failed:

This indicates that the worker process on ``{HOST}`` is listening on port 
``{PORT}`` has gone down for some reason and this worker process is just letting 
you know. You should check the logs for the worker process running on ``{HOST}:{PORT}`` 
to see if there is anything in there indicating why it went down. If there is 
nothing there and the logs look like they just stopped abruptly, see the
FAQ on :ref:`worker process resetting <faq-worker_resets>`.

.. _faq-worker_resets:

Q: Why is my worker process resetting periodically with no indication of what happened in the logs?
###################################################################################################

If your worker process dies with no indication as to why it died, it is probably 
the Supervisor that killed it. The Supervisor is not always that kind and will sometimes 
shoot a process with a ``kill -9``. There are usually two reasons why the Supervisor 
will kill a worker: either the worker has stopped heartbeating or Nimbus has 
decided to reschedule it somewhere else.

The best way to know is to see if the worker process starts up again on the 
same host and port. If it does, then your worker probably stopped heartbeating. If 
it starts up somewhere else, then Nimbus probably rescheduled it. Nimbus rescheduling 
is unlikely if your process is restarting regularly. If you think this is happening, 
contact the Storm team and we can help debug what is going on.

If your worker stopped heartbeating, the most likely suspect is Java Garbage Collection. 
If the Supervisor does not see heartbeats from your process for more then 30 seconds, 
it assumes it is dead and will try to restart it. Heartbeats are on a separate 
high-priority thread and only world garbage collection tends 
to stop them. Please look at the size of the heap you are using, but be careful 
to not go over 3.5 GB without checking with the Storm team first.

.. _faq-auth_errs:

Q: Why am I seeing "Authentication challenge without WWW-Authenticate header" errors in my topology?
####################################################################################################

The "Authentication challenge without WWW-Authenticate header" typically is because 
the YCA authentication filter violates the HTTP specification by returning a 
"not authenticated" response code without providing challenge information. Some 
HTTP clients return this, like the one that we have used with the Registry Service. 
This usually means that you included a YCAv2 header in the request to the Registry 
Service, but did not go through the HTTP proxy. We usually have this set on all 
the gateways by default. If you ran your topology from a hosted gateway and got 
this error please `file an issue <http://yo/ystorm-request>`_ 
to let us know. If it was from your launcher box, you probably need to configure it. 
See the `Http Proxy Node List TODO_LINK_NEEDED`_ for 
the available HTTP proxies by colo.

If you are setting it for a launcher box you probably want to set it through 
``yinst`` with something like the following::

    yinst set "ystorm.http_registry_proxy=http://httpproxy-res.red.ygrid.yahoo.com:4080‚Äù

If you can also set ``"http.registry.proxy"`` manually either on the command line with ``-c``, 
or programmatically in the conf map.

.. _faq-jdk_version:

Q: Which JDK version does yStorm support?
#########################################

Storm at Oath (yStorm) supports JDK8 on 64-bit OS. On grid gateway, make sure that you are 
using ``/home/gs/java/jdk64/current/``.

.. _faq-launch_storm:

Q: What are the basic steps to launch Storm topologies?
#######################################################

#. ``kinit``
#. ``storm jar YourJar YourClass YourTopology``
#. Use your topology. 
#. ``storm kill YourTopology``

.. _faq-kerberos_cache:

Q: Why did StormSummitter fail to find the principal from the Kerberos cache?
#############################################################################

Please make sure that you don't have any environment settings for ``krb5``. 

Please check by running the following::

    set | grep -i krb5

If you find any ``krb5`` key in the environment, please unset them. 

Example::

    unset KRB5CCNAME

.. _faq-dependency_isolation:

Q: Does Storm support dependency isolation?
###########################################

Storm does not currently support dependency isolation, and Storm's class path takes 
precedence over the topology jar. This means that for the time being you are limited 
in what you can have as a dependency. See the full list of `Storm-0.10's dependencies <https://git.ouroath.com/storm/storm/blob/master-security/storm-core/pom.xml>`_. and `Storm-2.x's dependencies <https://git.ouroath.com/storm/storm/blob/master/pom.xml>`_.

One common dependencies that may cause you problems is ``Guava``.

.. _faq-incompatible_libs:

Q: Are there any libraries that Storm is not compatible with?
#############################################################

After the 0.8.2 release, Storm switched to ``logback`` for it's logging framework 
with a shim layer that supports some of the ``log4j`` APIs. If you include ``log4j`` 
in your class path it has been known to cause issue.

Q: Do I need special network access for my topology?
