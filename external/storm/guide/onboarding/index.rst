In this chapter, we'll show you how to get on-board to the non-production environment for Storm.
The process make take several days based on your request and
the response of the Grid team. In the future, the on-boarding
process to Storm will be automated, and thus, automatic.

Creating a Storm Project
========================

#. Go to the `Grid Support Shop <http://yo/supportshop>`_.
#. From the **Grid Support Shop**, click **Storm Onboarding**.

#. You'll be taken to a Doppler form to create a Storm project. Click **Create a new project**
   and then confirm by clicking **New Project** in the pop-up confirmation window.
#. In the **New Storm Project** page, enter a project name in the **Project Name** text field, 
   a unique headless user (use your own user name if you don't have a headless user) in the
   **Unique Headless User** text field, and a short project description indicating that this
   is a test project.
#. From the **Contact Info** section of the page, select **Real User** from the **Contact Type** menu,
   your role (use **Technical Lead** if you're not sure) from the **Role** menu, and enter your
   Yahoo user name for the **User ID** text field. 
#. Click **Submit New Project**. You'll be taken to a confirmation page. The turnover rate varies,
   but generally, you'll be on-boarded within a few business days.

Create a New Topology
=====================

#. From your the **Storm Project** page, you'll see your project name listed as one of the projects that you 
   a member of or have selected as a favorite. Click the project name to open your project page.
#. From your project page, click the **New topology** button under the label **Topologies**.
#. From the **New Topology** page, enter the following information in the form:

   - **Topology Name** - Enter a unique string. For the first tutorial, you'll be using logging
     data from the Rainbow Data Highway,  so you might use a relevant topology name.
   - **Topology Short Description** - Again, your description should be related to your project.
     If you are creating a topology for one of the `Tutorials <../tutorials>`_, enter
     a related description.
   - **Environment Type** - Select **Non-Production**.
   - **Cluster** - Select any of the non-production environments.
#. Click **Submit New Topology Request**.
#. The Grid SEs will review your request before approving it. You also may need to answer questions.
   The entire process can take from three to five working days.

Next Step
=========

Try the `Tutorial: <>`_ or on-board to the production environment by
following the same steps above but selecting **Production** and specifying
your capacity needs, whether you need Rainbow Data Highway integration,
