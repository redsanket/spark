In this chapter, you'll find a tutorial that 
shows you how to run an example using the Data Highway (DH) Rainbow spout
and a bolt to count DH events. We hope to have more tutorials in the future,
so please come back, or better yet, contribute your own tutorials
to help others using `our tutorial template <https://git.corp.yahoo.com/hadoop/docs/raw/master/external/storm/guide/tutorials/tutorial_template.rst>`_.
