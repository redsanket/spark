Getting Started With Storm at Yahoo
===================================

.. _hbase_getting_started-installation:

In this chapter, we'll show you how to get started using Storm on the Yahoo grid.
We'll work directly with a Git repository, modify some code, and watch
the results in real time. 

Creating a Storm Project
========================

#. Go to the `Grid Support Shop <http://yo/supportshop>`_.
#. From the **Grid Support Shop**, click **Storm Onboarding**.

#. You'll be taken to a Doppler form to create a Storm project. Click **Create a new project**
   and then confirm by clicking **New Project** in the pop-up confirmation window.
#. In the **New Storm Project** page, enter a project name in the **Project Name** text field, 
   a unique headless user (use your own user name if you don't have a headless user) in the
   **Unique Headless User** text field, and a short project description indicating that this
   is a test project.
#. From the **Contact Info** section of the page, select **Real User** from the **Contact Type** menu,
   your role (use **Technical Lead** if you're not sure) from the **Role** menu, and enter your
   Yahoo user name for the **User ID** text field. 
#. Click **Submit New Project**. You'll be taken to a confirmation page. The turnover rate varies,
   but generally, you'll be on-boarded within a few business days.
