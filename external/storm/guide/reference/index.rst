Deployment at Oath
===================

We host several non-production and production storm clusters for Oath and Verizon. Please visit `dopper <http://yo/doppler-storm>`_ for the details.


Use Case Example
================

In this particular use case, the Search team wants to 
index editorial real-time content that users 
can search. The editorial content needs to be available in Apache HBase. 

Topography Overview
-------------------

Spouts
######

They will need a spout that scans HBase since the last scan 
until the current time to get the editorial content.

Bolts
##### 

They will need two bolts: The first to build the index
and store it back into HBase, and the 
second to push the index for serving.

Logging
=======

The logs for the Storm daemon are located by default in ``${storm.home}/logs``. 
The <code>ystorm`` daemons (``nimbus``, ``ui``, ``supervisor</code>, etc.) write 
logs to ${YINST_ROOT}/y/lib64/storm/current/logs.

For example::

    /home/y/lib64/storm/current/logs
    /home/y/lib64/storm/current/logs/logviewer.log
    /home/y/lib64/storm/current/logs/nimbus.log
    /home/y/lib64/storm/current/logs/supervisor.log
    /home/y/lib64/storm/current/logs/ui.log
    ...

The <code>ystorm_*</code> launcher scripts have logs as well. If the ystorm daemons 
fail to write logs, check the launcher logs::

    /home/y/logs/ystorm_daemons/nimbus/current
    /home/y/logs/ystorm_daemons/supervisor/current
    /home/y/logs/ystorm_daemons/ui/current
    ...

Nimbus Log
----------

**File:** ``/home/y/lib64/storm/current/logs/nimbus.log``

Startup
#######

The first thing we expect to see when Nimbus starts is some diagnostic output from ZooKeeper/Curator code and then 
the message "Starting nimbus with conf..." as seen below::

Shutdown
########

Shutdown is similar with the message "Shutting down master" followed by "Shut down master"::

    2013-11-08 18:44:32 b.s.d.nimbus [INFO] Shutting down master
    2013-11-08 18:44:32 o.a.z.ZooKeeper [INFO] Session: 0x142368cbb2f0001 closed

    2013-11-08 18:44:32 b.s.d.nimbus [INFO] Shut down master


Topology Submission, Assignment, and Killing
--------------------------------------------

When topologies are submitted, the log message will being with "Received topology submission for..."::

    2013-11-08 18:09:21 b.s.d.nimbus [INFO] Received topology submission for test-topo-derekd2 with conf {"storm.id" "test-topo-derekd2-8-1383934161", "topology.users" ("derekd" "derekd@DEREKD.YSTORM.NET"), "topology.acker.executors" nil, "to ...
    2013-11-08 18:09:21 b.s.d.nimbus [INFO] nimbus file location:/home/y/var/storm/nimbus/stormdist/test-topo-derekd2-8-1383934161 ...

This is following by "Activating ..."::


    2013-11-08 18:09:21 b.s.d.nimbus [INFO] Activating test-topo-derekd2: test-topo-derekd2-8-1383934161 ...

Assignments are the result of scheduling, so when a topology has successfully 
been scheduled, or has been re-balanced, etc., you'll see the message "Setting new assignment for topology id..."::

    2013-11-08 18:09:21 b.s.d.nimbus [INFO] Setting new assignment for topology id test-topo-derekd2-8-1383934161: #backtype.storm.daemon.common.Assignment{:master-code-dir "/home/y/var/storm/nimbus/stormdist/test-topo-derekd2-8-1383934161", ...

When topologies are killed, you'll see the following log messages:

- Delaying event :remove for X secs for ...
- Updated ... with status {:type :killed, :kill-time-secs X}
- Killing topology: ...
- Cleaning up ...

For example::

    2013-11-08 18:13:40 b.s.d.nimbus [INFO] Delaying event :remove for 30 secs for test-topo-derekd2-9-1383934302
    2013-11-08 18:13:40 b.s.d.nimbus [INFO] Updated test-topo-derekd2-9-1383934302 with status {:type :killed, :kill-time-secs 30}
    2013-11-08 18:14:10 b.s.d.nimbus [INFO] Killing topology: test-topo-derekd2-9-1383934302
    2013-11-08 18:14:15 b.s.d.nimbus [INFO] Cleaning up test-topo-derekd2-9-1383934302

Supervisors can be seen in the Nimbus log by looking for their IDs, which look 
like UUIDs. For example: <code>7c024f9d-673d-49e7-aa7f-56d9e535f994</code>

Supervisor Log 
--------------

**File:** /home/y/lib64/storm/current/logs/supervisor.log

    
Startup/Shutdown
################

Supervisors start with a log message similar to "Starting supervisor with id ....". 
The supervisor does not log a message when it is stopped manually.

Launching & Killing Workers
###########################

The Supervisor's job is to start workers. When the supervisor launches a worker, 
we expect a pair of log messages beginning with "Launching worker ..."
as shown below::

    2013-11-08 18:11:43 b.s.d.supervisor [INFO] Launching worker with assignment #backtype.storm.daemon.supervisor.LocalAssignment{:st
    2013-11-08 18:11:43 b.s.d.supervisor [INFO] Launching worker with command: java -server -Xmx768m  -Djava.library.path=/home/y/var/

:timed-out versus :disallowed
*****************************

There could be several reasons a worker shuts down. 

- If the worker has been "un-scheduled", there will be a log message that includes 
  "Shutting down and clearing state for id ... State: :disallowed".
- If a worker hangs such that it does not heartbeat to the supervisor within the 
  expected interval (5s default), you should see a log message like "Shutting down 
  and clearing state for id ... State: :timed-out".
- If a worker crashes, you should see a log message involving an exit code
  such as "Worker process ... exited with code: X".

For example::

    2013-11-08 06:04:19 b.s.d.supervisor [INFO] Shutting down and clearing state for id 0c8439c6-a4fe-47c4-9c62-b8d06e44aa98. Current supervisor time: 1383890658. State: :timed-out, Heartbeat: #backtype.storm.daemon.common.WorkerHeartbeat{:ti ...
    ...
    2013-11-08 18:22:13 b.s.d.supervisor [INFO] Shutting down and clearing state for id e7846155-3656-424f-84bf-f133e5891c81. Current supervisor time: 1383934933. State: :disallowed, Heartbeat: #backtype.storm.daemon.common.WorkerHeartbeat{:t ...
    2013-11-08 18:22:13 b.s.d.supervisor [INFO] Worker Process e7846155-3656-424f-84bf-f133e5891c81 exited with code: 137

.. tip:: If a log message indicates that a worker is :timed-out, then it means the heartbeat 
         thread was starved from being scheduled to run. This can happen because the garbage 
         collection takes over the JVM. If this happens repeatedly with a worker, try 
         submitting the topology with an increased worker JVM heap size: <code>append -Xmx${SIZE_MB}m</code> 
         to <code>topology.worker.childopts</code>.

Worker Log
----------

**File:**  ``/home/y/var/storm/workers-artifacts/${YOUR-TOPOLOGY-ID}/${PORT-NUMBER}/worker.log``
    
Startup/Shutdown
################

When a worker starts, you should see similar ZooKeeper/Curator diagnostic logs, followed by a 
log message similar to "Launching worker for ${TOPOLOGY_NAME} on ${SUPERVISOR_ID}:${WORKER_PORT} with id ${WORKER_ID}".

For example::

    Launching worker for test-topo-derekd-1-1383340860 on 04fa4628-2ab9-468b-b457-c36079921b80:6701 with id 7737e1f4-eec4-4975-87ef-81541496009e

Normally, a worker is not shut down. When it is, the current storm implementation 
kills the process (``kill -9``), so we do not expect the logs to show anything as the 
worker does not know what is happening.

Cleanup configuration
################

For limiting the disk usage of workers' logs and dump files, two parameters are defined to restrict all workers' total usage and each worker's usage: logviewer.max.sum.worker.logs.size.mb, logviewer.max.per.worker.logs.size.mb. Cluster admins may customize their thresholds as needed.
