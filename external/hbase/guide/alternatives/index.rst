HBase and Alternatives

HBase
=====

Introduction
------------

Apache HBase is an open source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented store modeled 
after Google's `BigTable <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable>`_: A Distributed 
Storage System for Structured Data by Chang et al. 
Just as BigTable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the 
`Google File System <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System>`_, Apache 
HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of Hadoop and the `Hadoop distributed file 
system (HDFS) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDFS#Hadoop_distributed_file_system>`_.


Although HBase provides a relational database view over data (row and columns), it does not 
support SQL. Instead of `Google's Chubby lock service <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_lock_manager#Google.27s_Chubby_lock_service>`_, 
HBase uses `Apache ZooKeeper <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_ZooKeeper>`_ as 
the coordination service. The following description is for both HBase and 
BigTable unless otherwise specified. The HBase terms are used as default and 
BigTable corresponding names are mentioned in bracket.

Features
--------

The following are the notable features of HBase:

- Linear and modular scalability.
- Strictly consistent reads and writes.
- Automatic and configurable sharding of tables.
- Automatic failover support between RegionServers.
- Convenient base classes for backing Hadoop MapReduce jobs with Apache HBase tables.
- Easy to use Java API for client access.
- Block cache and Bloom filters for real-time queries.
- Query predicate push down using server-side filters.
- Extensible JRuby-based (JIRB) shell.
- Support for exporting metrics via the Hadoop metrics subsystem to files or Ganglia; or via JMX.

Design Overview
---------------

HDFS supports immutable files called HFile [SSTable]. HBase must split the table 
into several HFile and remember the associate HFiles to a table. The range of rows 
assigned to a HFile is called Region [tablet]. Column families are stored in 
separate HFiles. To modify the table content, HRegionServer [the tablet server] loads 
the content of the corresponding HFile, manipulates the data in its memory, writes 
the resulting content to a new HFile, and deletes the previous one. An index of the 
HFile data is kept at the end of the file.

Being loaded into memory implies that all sorting within a HFile can be done 
efficiently. It also implies possible data loss after a sudden crash. To avoid 
that, all modifications are first stored in a log, HLoge. A HRegionServer uses one
HLoge for all loaded regions to reduce the number of writes to the file system. 
Periodically, the data from memory is written into some HFile, which is called 
compaction. During compaction, no read and write is serviced.

To keep the metadata in normally limited size files, they are arranged in a tree 
of depth 2 to cover a large enough number of regions. The address of the root HFile 
region is kept in ZooKeeper [Chubby]. HBaseMaster [master] assigns regions to 
HRegionServers. The assignment is kept in ZooKeeper. Single-row transactions are 
supported using locks on ZooKeeper.

When to Use

The most important consideration when looking at HBase is that, while it is a 
great solution to many problems, it is not a silver bullet. HBase is not optimized 
for classic transactional applications or even relational analytics. It is also 
not a complete substitute for HDFS when doing large batch MapReduce. Take a look 
at some of the differences detailed in the sections below to get a sense of which 
applications are a good fit for HBase. If you still have questions, you
can always subscribe to yahoo-hbase-users@oath.com or even to the 
`public user list <mailto:user-subscribe@hbase.apache.org>`_.

So, why should you use HBase? If your application does the following, you should 
consider HBase:

- uses a variable schema where each row is slightly different.
- canâ€™t add columns fast enough and most of them are ``NULL`` in each row.
- stores data in collections. For example: some meta data, message data or binary data 
  is keyed on the same value.
- needs key-based access to data when storing or retrieving.

Differences Between HBase and BigTable
--------------------------------------

BigTable categorizes the column families into locality groups and maintain all in 
the same file, while HBase keeps each column family in a separate file. Being in 
separate files implies more cost for accessing two fields from the same row.

How Data is Structured in HBase
-------------------------------

Data is structured in HTables in the following way:

- The row is the primary key.
- The timestamp is used to separate versions of an entry.
- The columns are in the format, which is predefined and could be an arbitrary string.

HBase vs. SQL 
-------------

In contrast with SQL, HBase:

- Uses an iterator (Scanner) over all rows.
- Has no secondary index: there is no actual index, but the rows are physically sorted 
  based on the row key. 
- Has no advanced functions such as ``join``, ``groupby``, 
  ``having``, etc. These must be rather be implemented by the developer.
- Can use  restricted iterators to resemble ``select``, and ``update``, and ``delete`` 
  on individual iterated rows.
- Supports transactions only for rows.

Alternatives (NoSQL)
====================

For more information, see the slideshare presentation 
`NoSQL Options Compared <http://www.slideshare.net/tazija/nosql-options-compared>`_.

Column-Oriented Store
---------------------

Each storage block contains data from only one column.

Examples
########

`Cassandra <http://cassandra.apache.org/>`_ provides a structured key-value store. 
Keys can map to multiple values, which are grouped into column families. The 
column families are fixed when a Cassandra database is created, but columns can 
be added to a family at any time. Furthermore, columns are added only to specified 
keys, so different keys can have different numbers of columns.

Document Store
--------------

Stores documents made up of tagged elements.

Examples
########

`CouchBase <http://www.couchbase.com/wiki/display/couchbase/Home>`_ - was intended to be 
a fast key-value store/cache aimed primarily at Web apps. It later added the ability to 
persist data and handle complex queries. Data is stored in JSON documents. 

See also `MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org/>`_.

Key-Value Store
---------------

Hash table of keys and values.

Examples
########

`Redis <http://redis.io/>`_ is primarily an in-memory database. While it does have some 
capability for persisting data to disk, its primary use is as a blazingly fast in-memory 
product. While it uses a key-value model, Redis should not be confused for a simple 
in-memory cache, although it does enable expiration to be set for data items, as would a 
cache.


Graph Database
--------------

Stores data in the nodes and relationships of a graph.

Examples
########

`Neo4j <http://www.neo4j.org/>`_ describes itself as an "embedded, disk-based, fully 
transactional Java persistence engine that stores data structured in graphs rather than in 
tables."
