# Hadoop Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains the documentation for Hadoop users and for the Yahoo team
developing Hadoop technology. The Hadoop user documentation can be found in the
`external` directory, where each technology is given its own directory. For example,
if you wanted to see the user documentation for Hive, you would look in `hadoop/docs/external/hive`.


## Authoring Format

The external documentation is generally authored in reStructuredText and rendered into HTML.
The internal documentation will generally be in Markdown and might not be rendered or published.

## Where Do I View the Rendered External Documentation?

The user documentation can be found on devel.corp.yahoo.com. For example,
the Hive User Guide can be found at http://devel.corp.yahoo.com/hive/guide.

The following is the general URI syntax for documentation: `http://devel.corp.yahoo.com/{hadoop_product}/guide` 

## What if I Find Issues With the Documentation?

We welcome users to file issues or make pull requests, so if you
find a mistake or can't find information, let us know by filing an issue.
If you think you can write the documentation, please do and make a PR.
Our team will review your PR, make comments/suggestions, and eventually
merge your PR.
