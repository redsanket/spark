Overview
========

- **Logs Categories:**

  - Server Logs: record all requests that were made of the server: IP, URL, response, ..etc. they provide access and error logs
  - Application Server Logs: logs generated by applications. This helps understanding how the application is used.
    Logs generated by hadoop daemons can be considered Application level.

- **Types of Logs:**

  - ``.log``: Logs of running daemons will be available here in this .log file.
  - ``.out``: will have startup messages of a daemon. These messages will be useful to troubleshoot startup failures of a daemon.
  - ``.log.{timestamp}.(bz2|gz)``: Old log files will have date in their name. by default log rotation is daily.
  - ``gc-{component}.log-{yyyyMMddHHmm}``: GC logs for each component  (namenode, datanode, ..etc)

Hadoop offers CLI to browse the logs

- **applications logs:** ``yarn logs -applicationId <application ID> [OPTIONS]``
  - am <AM Containers> Prints the AM Container logs for this application.
  - containerId <Container ID> it will only print syslog if the application is running. Work with ``-logFiles`` to get other logs.
  - logFiles <Log File Name> Work with -am/-containerId and specify comma-separated value to get specified container log files.
  Use "ALL" to fetch all the log files for the container.

- **job logs:** ``mapred job [-logs <job-id> <task-attempt-id>]``
