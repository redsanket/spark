# Note that this component install is different than that of Core,
# Core is yinst packaged and dropped on admin node where the install
# package is executed as root. This install does not need root and can 
# be delivered directly to the component node from the RE node.
#
# inputs: cluster to install pig on
# returns: 0 on success
