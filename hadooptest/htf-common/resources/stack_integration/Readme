Prototype feed processing for a feed/instance, a jenkins job (StackIntTesting-Prototype) fires
a script 'start-mgr.sh', this script copies 'mgr.sh' and supporting files to OOZIE_HOST and
fires 'mgr.sh' which is a driver/manager that populates an oozie workflow spec and job properties 
file, and submits the oozie job to OOZIE_HOST which uses java, pig and hive actions to process 
and store input data replicated from GDM into the stackint test cluster (for now, DenseB). 

Usage:
Prototype/start-mgr.sh is used directly by Jenkins to invoke mgr.sh

Standalone usage:
Prototype/mgr.sh <feed> <datestamp> <timestamp>
Example:
./mgr.sh bidded_clicks 20150401 0000

Jenkins job:
http://re101.ygrid.corp.gq1.yahoo.com:4443/jenkins/view/H2-IntTests/job/StackIntTesting-Prototype/

This currently runs on cluster DenseB, with oozie, hive and pig installed
on dense34. The oozie workflows are on this server:
