	
And I've never been to Denver	
And I’ve never been to Boston in the fall	
And I’ve never been to Moscow	
And I’ve never been to Tampa	
And I’ve never buried treasure in St. Louie or St. Paul	
And if you ask us to do anything	
We are the pirates who don’t do anything 	
We just stay at home and lie around	
We'll just tell you we don’t do anything	
Well I’ve never been to Greenland
