hadooptest README
---
hadooptest is an automation framework for Yahoo core Hadoop.

The framework currently contains an API which allows for:
 
. Running jobs on pseudodistributed clusters, and associated tasks with 
  monitoring and manipulating jobs and tasks.
. A programmatic debugger interface which allows for setting watch points
  and breakpoints in a standalone cluster, using the JDI / JPDA.
. Further architecture to define automated test structure and interfaces
  to other types of Hadoop clusters.
