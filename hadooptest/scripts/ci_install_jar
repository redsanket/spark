# This script needs to be run before maven build can be run with the profile
# "profile-ci" for building the maven package. The maven build is run primarily
# on the RE hosts (corp side), and occasionally on the gateway client
# (colo side). This script pulls in the depedent jar files. The reason this is 
# separate process and is not integrated with maven dependency is that 
# yjava_byauth is accessible only from corp side via the ymaven repository, 
# but cannot be accessed if building on the gateway client on the colo.

/usr/local/bin/yinst install yjava_byauth
