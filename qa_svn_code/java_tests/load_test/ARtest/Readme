ARtest
bash script wrapper that submits a set of 4 java generic-wordcount jobs to a cluster in a loop, 
immediate goal is generate a constant minimal load on two of AxoniteRed's queues, this is for 
SupportShop development for hadoop 2.0 and metrics gathering.

The wc jobs are self contained in that they generate their own input data and will take the number 
of input files to generate as an arg, they also accept the run queue to submit to as another arg. 
The bash script acts as a little driver for these jobs, modify the bash script as desired to:
- increase/decrease each wc job's runtime by increase/decrease the infiles to use
- alter the inter-job submission directly using the 'sleep'
- alter the queues to use by mod of the two QUEUEx shell vars, add vars if you want more queues 

Tested on AR's node gsrd228n17.red.ygrid.yahoo.com 
         
Usage;
1. ssh to a node of the cluster under test
2. mkdir a working area
3. svn co 
4. ./buildme ARtest
5. ./runme
6. verify on RM GUI that jobs 'genericWordcount_job_infile_*' are succesfully completing
7. check queue utilization for activity

Example;
1. ssh  gsrd228n17.red.ygrid.yahoo.com
2. mkdir /tmp/phw; cd /tmp/phw
3. svn co $SVNROOT/yahoo/platform/grid/projects/trunk/hudson/internal/HadoopQEAutomation/branch-23/java_tests/ARtest
4. ./buildme  ARtest

6. check 'http://axonitered-jt1.red.ygrid.yahoo.com:8088/cluster/apps' for job status
7. should see 'unfunded' and 'UDA' queues showing activity
