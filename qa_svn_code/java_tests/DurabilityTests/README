Hadoop 23 Durability Tests

These tests are combination regression and durability, initial motivation was to regression
check for Kerb TGT and token issues that would not show up until significant time has passed,
like 24 hr TGT renewal, expired token renewal, and such. It's nice to be able to run jobs
for long periods, so they've been adapted to be general purpose durability tests.

Building them is done by compiling against the target cluster, this is not pretty but is
does make sure you are running against the code under test, necessary if you've got a
Dev tarball overlay since there's no way to pull non-checked in code from git or svn. 

--run24hour_job-- 
this takes a number of hours to run as an arg and basically runs small
wordcount jobs with a short sleep inbetween for (at least) that long. Run appoaches are:
25 hours: this is a regression check for the "AB token bug"
72 hours: regression check for the compute node's internal secret key cache roll
169 hours: 1 week plus 1 hour, renewal limit window of a TGT

There's a jar built on elrdon using 0.23.6 with Daryn's token renewal fix SNAPSHOT,
you will likely want to rebuild your own jar, suggested approach is to cp all of the files
in this svn dir to the RM or NN (any node really, but GWs can be iffy) of your test cluster 
and do:

buildme <CLUSTERNAME> run24hour_job

Running from cmdline is described in src comment header.
