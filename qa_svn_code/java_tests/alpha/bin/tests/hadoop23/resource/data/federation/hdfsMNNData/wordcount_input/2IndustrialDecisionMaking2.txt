THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

MILTIADIS BOBOULOS

The Theory of Constraints (TOC) is a portfolio of management philosophies, management disciplines, and industry-specific "best practices" developed and popularised over the past 20 years by physicist Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt and his associates. Most people are first exposed to the concepts through his book TheGoal, (North River Press, 1984).

Dr. Goldratt has been described byFortune Magazine as a guru to industry and by Business Week as a genius. His booksThe Goal, It's Not Luck, andCritical Chain, gripping fast paced business novels, are transforming management thinking throughout the world.

Goldratt's Theory of Constraints is being used by thousands of corporations, and is taught in over 200 colleges, universities and business schools. His books have sold over 3 million copies and have been translated into 23 languages. The Theory of Constraints is an overall philosophy, usually applied to running and improving an organisation. TOC consists of Problem Solving and Management/Decision-Making Tools called the Thinking Processes (TP). TOC is applied to logically and systematically answer these three questions essential to any process of ongoing improvement: "What to change?" "To what to change?"

"How to cause the change?"

More specific uses of the Thinking Processes can be used to significantly enhance vital management skills, such as: win-win conflict resolution effective communication team building skills delegation empowerment Famous for spectacular results, the use of TOC has resulted in Proven Solutions created by applying the Thinking Processes (TP) in specific functional areas such as Sales, Marketing, Logistics, Finance, Accounting, Engineering and Project Management. Many of these solutions are discussed in detail in the books: The Goal, The Race, It's Not Luck and Critical Chain.

TOC recognises that the output of any system that consists of multiple steps where the output of one step depends on the output of one or more previous steps will be limited (or constrained) by the least productive steps. In other words, as

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

MILTIADIS BOBOULOS

paraphrased in The Goal, the strength of any chain is dependant upon its weakest link.

Where manufacturing is concerned, TOC postulates that the goal is to make (more) money. It describes three avenues to this goal: Increase Throughput, Reduce Inventory, Reduce Operating Expense As Dr. Goldratt notes, the opportunities to make more money through reductions in inventory and operating expense are limited by zero. The opportunities to make more money by increasing Throughput, on the other hand, are not limited. More than that, though, TOC challenges us to define a goal and re-examine all of our actions and measurements based on how well or how poorly they serve it. This is done through a set of tools that help us identify and resolve bottlenecks.

Fundamental Analysis of the Theory of Constraints

The Theory of Constraints, as it is commonly called, recognises that organisations exist to achieve a goal. A factor that limits a company’s ability to achieve more of its goal is referred to as a "constraint." In The Goal, the demand for parts produced by a computer-controlled piece of equipment known as the NCX10 exceeded the machine’s capacity. Since the factory could only assemble and sell as many products as they had parts from the machine, the capacity of the factory to make money was tied directly to the output of the NCX10. The NCX10, therefore, was the constraint.

It is imperative for businesses to identify and manage constraints. "Because a constraint is a factor that limits the system from getting more of whatever it strives for, then a business manager who wants more profits must manage the constraints. There really is no choice in the matter. Either you manage constraints or they manage you." Noreen, Smith, and Mackey in The Theory of Constraintsand its Implications for Management Accounting (North River Press, 1995).

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

MILTIADIS BOBOULOS

The Theory of Constraints, then, is a management philosophy that focuses the organisations scarce resources on improving the performance of the true constraint, and therefore the bottom line of the organisation. Goldratt uses a ChainAnalogy1 to help illustrate why this is the most effective way to get immediate results.

It may be relatively easy intellectually to recognise that an organisation must have a constraint, but it may be quite another thing to positively identify it. In situations when the constraint can be easily identified (which is usually because it is a physical constraint such as the machine known as the "NCX10" in the book The Goal), the five step Process Of On Going Improvement2 will provide the steps necessary to deal with the constraint. In situations when the constraint is not as easily sited (which is often because it has to do with the inter-relationships between the various "links" in the organisational "chain"), the ThinkingProcesses3 will provide the tools necessary to identify the core problem or core conflict and the tools needed to deal with it effectively.

About Chain Analogy

A manufacturing company can

be thought of as a chain of

dependent events that are linked

together like a chain. The

activities that go on in one "link"

are dependent upon the activities

that occur in the preceding "link."

The manufacturer in the example

above fabricates products to order. First they market their services. If the marketing is successful they will get some requests for proposals, and create

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

MILTIADIS BOBOULOS

some bids. If some bids are successful they will procure the necessary materials. Once the materials are on hand they will manufacture the product. Once manufacturing is complete packaging prepares the product to be sent to the customer. Finally, once packaged, the product can be shipped to the customer. We notice that each step is dependent on the preceding step. That is, the product cannot be shipped until after it is packaged; the product can not be packaged until it is manufactured; the product cannot be manufactured until the necessary materials are procured; etc. It is this dependency that explains why the Theory of Constraints is so powerful when compared with "conventional wisdom." The chain pictured above is for a very simple company. Even so, it doesn’t really picture all the operations in the company. For example, billing and collection are not included. The typical company has a much more complex chain than is pictured here. To handle this complexity, management typically splits the chain up into links and endeavors to manage each link so as to "maximize" its performance. As a result, conventional wisdom is as follows:

• An improvement to any link in the chain is considered to be an improvement to the chain.

• System wide or "global" improvement is believed to be the sum of all the

"local" improvement made within each link.

• This is analogous to saying the primary measurement of success in managing the chain is the weight of the chain, i.e. if one manager beefs up her/his link that makes the chain heavier and better.

As a result, all managers compete for scarce resources all the time. They all want

5

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

MILTIADIS BOBOULOS

to reach their goal of maximising the weight of their link, because they believe that is the way to maximise the effectiveness of the organisation. By considering the following true story from a printing company, we’ll see another view. A team from a press operation in the middle of their system came to management with a proposal for continuous improvement. (We should think of them as being located in the manufacturing link above.) They had discovered an improvement that could be made to their press that would increase productivity 25%! It would cost the company only $20,000. Conventional analysis showed the payback period on this was relatively short. Would you authorise the investment? Senior managers were about to sign the check when someone asked, "Where does the output of this press go? And, what is the status of work-in-process at that next operation?" It turned out that work was already queued up at the next operation. In other words, the company almost spent $20,000 so that the output of the press in question could wait 25% longer at the next operation! Had they made the expenditure they may have had a false sense of success when viewing the 25% increase in the "productivity" figures of the press, but the actual bottom line impact would have been a negative $20,000 because that money was spent without actually bringing any more money into the plant!

TOC Wisdom

TOC says that management needs to find the weak link in the chain. In the

6

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

MILTIADIS BOBOULOS

example above it turned out that manufacturing was the weak link. That is to say that marketing was attracting sufficient requests for proposals, and bidding was winning a sufficient number of bids to keep the plant busy, and procurement was able to get the necessary parts on time, and packaging could handle everything that was manufactured, and shipping could keep up with packaging, BUT

manufacturing could not keep up with the schedule.

In this case, what would be the bottom line impact of "beefing up" or improving the packaging link? Some cost savings may be produced, but the long term impact on the bottom line will probably not be great because it did not enable the company to fill any more orders than they are currently. (We remember that it is manufacturing that is limiting the rate at which orders are fulfilled.) The same holds true for shipping, procurement, marketing, and bidding. The one place where a significant impact can be made on the bottom line is at the constraint – in manufacturing in this example. The old saying

4. Elevate, and

5. Go back to Step 1

Identify

In order to manage a constraint, it is first necessary to identify it. In Eli Goldratt's book The Goal (North River Press, 1984), a machine known as the NCX10 was identified as the constraint. This knowledge helped the company determine where an increase in "productivity" would lead to increased profits. Concentrating on a non-constraint resource would not increase the throughput (the rate at which money comes into the system through sales) because there would not be an increase in the number of orders fulfilled. There might be local gains, such as a reduction or elimination of the queue of work-in-process waiting in front of the ut if that material ends up wa

increase

Exploit

Once the constraint is identified, the next step is to focus on how to get more production within the existing capacity limitations. Goldratt refers to this as exploiting the constraint. One example from The Goal was when the company and the labour union agreed to stagger lunches, breaks, and shift changes so the e could be producing during times

machin

it previously sat idle. This added

significantly to the output of the NCX10, and therefore to the output of the entire plant.

Subordinate

Exploiting the constraint does not insure that the materials needed next by the constraint will always show up on time. This is often because these materials are waiting in queue at a non-constraint resource that is running a job that the constraint doesn’t need yet. Subordination is necessary to prevent this from happening. This usually involves significant changes to current (and generally long

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

established) ways of doing things at the non-constraint resources. Elevate

After the constraint is identified, the available capacity is exploited, and the nonconstraint resources have been subordinated, the next step is to determine if the output of the constraint is enough to supply market demand. If so, there is no need at this time to "elevate" because this process is no longer the constraint of the system. In that case the market would be the constraint, and the TOC Thinking Process should be used to develop a marketing solution. However, we should be ctivate the res

If, on the other hand, after fully Exploiting this process it still cannot produce enough product to meet market demand, it is necessary to find more capacity by

"elevating" the constraint. In The Goal, schedulers were able to remove some of the load from the constraint by rerouting it across two other machines. They also outsourced some work and brought in an older machine that could process some of the parts made by the NCX10. These were all ways of adding capacity, or elevating the constraint. It is important to note that to "elevate" comes after

"exploit" and "subordinate." Following greatest

This is not the case. A fundamental principle of the Theory Of Constraints is that

9

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

MILTIADIS BOBOULOS

the combination of dependent events (such as the steps in a production system) and normal variation (which is always present) makes it literally impossible to ever fully balance a line. There will always be a constraint in the system. What creates chaos is allowing the constraint to move around – and a so-called "balanced" system will always experience a moving constraint due to normal variation. For that reason, companies that get the greatest financial benefit from TOC are those that make a strategic choice of where they want the constraint to be. They then manage their entire operation (product design, marketing, capital investment, hiring, etc.) accordingly. This allows the company to manage the constraint to their advantage rather than allowing the constraint to manage them.

About Thinking Processes (TP)

The Thinking Processes can be used when the constraint of the system is not obvious. This is generally the case when the constraint is not a physical resource, but instead is in the market or in the

2. What to Change to?

3. How to Cause the Change?

The first question is the equivalent to the first step of the five step Process Of On Going Improvement: "Identify the Constraint?" Since these processes are generally used when the constraint is not a physical resource, there is usually no physical evidence (such as work-in-process inventory) to point you to the constraint. Instead you have to "map out" what is currently going on in your system. The logical mapping structure that is used at this point, is the "Current Reality Tree." This is not a simple task, but when it is completed successfully, we will know what to change.

That will bring us to the

intuitively obvious, there are two distinct steps to answering it. 1. Identify the breakthrough idea that will overcome the current constraint 2. Ensure that the "cure" that is derived will not be worse than the "disease." The "Evaporating Cloud" is used to break through the core conflict that is currently constraining the organization. Then the "Future Reality Tree" is used to ensure that the undesirable effects we now are experiencing will, indeed, be changed to desirable effects by this breakthrough idea. The unintended negative consequences of the proposed solution are usually identified at this point using what are called Negative Branches. If these bad things that result from a good u

action can be prevented, then we can be s re the cure will not be worse than the disease. Now we know what to change to.

That brings us to question 3, "How to cause the change?" The simple answer is: get the people who are going to have to live with the change to create the action plan that is needed for implementation. The Thinking Process pro-actively involves those who are most effected by the change. These people are solicited for their vision of what obstacles might prevent the organisation from moving forward on this breakthrough solution. The workers are used to generate all the additional ideas that are necessary to implement the original injection. Once these are known, a plan is mapped out. The tool

It is the equivalent of the first step of the five step Process Of On Going Improvement: "Identify the Constraint?" However, since the Thinking Processes are usually used when the constraint is not a physical resource, we can rarely use physical evidence like work in process (WIP) to identify the constraint. Instead, we start with the evidence that is available: the negative effects that are a

ive effects would be things such as

- lead times that are increasing;

- poor human relations within the organisation.

Goldratt calls these "Undesirable Effects" or UDEs. The key is to realise that the UDEs are not the "real" problem --they are only the visible effects of the real or

"core" problem. The challenge is to map out the interrelated web of cause-andeffect that links the undesirable effects together. Once completed, one is generally able to identify the "core problem" near the bottom of the logical map. This map is known as a "Current Reality Tree." Once properly constructed, we are the position to know what to change.

When using the Thinking Processes, the second of 3 questions we should ask ourselves is:

• "What to change to?"

The first step in determining the answer to this question is to understand why the core problem exists. (We should remember that the core problem was found at the base of the logical structure --known as the Current Reality Tree --that was formed to find the constraint of the system.) It is assumed that managers are not stupid. If there was an easy solution to this core problem, it would have been solved long ago. No, there must be some conflict that underlies the core problem. Once this core conflict is identified, it is necessary to develop a breakthrough idea (referred to as an "injection") that will resolve the conflict. This is accomplished using a tool known as the "Evaporating Cloud." The second step in determining "what to change to" is to test our breakthrough idea, our injection, to see if it will have the desired impact on your system. That is, would implementing the injection change the undesirable effects (UDEs) we are able effects (DEs)?

Future Reality Tree (FRT)

When using the Thinking Processes, the second of 3 questions we should ask is:

• "What to change to?"

The first step in determining the answer to this question is to determine the conflict that underlies the core problem using the mapping tool called the Evaporating Cloud. The main output of the Evaporating Cloud is a breakthrough idea, called an injection.

Once the injection is determined, we will have one necessary part of the solution. However, the injection is not sufficient to resolve the core problem. In fact, to be sure the proposed injection is indeed a "good" idea, it is important to check what the effect of implementing that idea would be.

Thus the second step in determining "what to change to" is to test your

13

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

MILTIADIS BOBOULOS

breakthrough injection, to see if it will have the desired impact on our system. That is, would implementing the injection change the undesirable effects (UDEs) we are now experiencing into desirable effects (DEs)? This is done by returning to the original map of undesirable effects (the Current Reality Tree) and inserting the injection at the appropriate place. Then, redraw the logical connections and see whether implementing this idea would, indeed, reverse the undesirable effects into desirable effects. If it works, we now know to what to change. This mapping tool used in this step is the "Future Reality Tree" because it gives us a good picture of what the future can look like if we can figure out how to implement the injection. Notice that at this point, it is not necessary to know how we can implement our injection. In fact, sometimes it will appear that the injection xt to impossible to implement --t

is ne

hat it will happen only when "pigs can fly." Such injections are referred to as "Flying Pig Injections." If this is the case for us, we should not be in despair. There are effective techniques for grounding a flying pig.

We are currently experiencing into desirable effects in the future, we will need the input of the people who will be most affected by the proposed changes in order to ensure successful implementation. The Thinking Processes are used in a very open and participatory fashion. We’ll work closely with the people who are going to be asked to change. Their involvement is absolutely vital to the long-term success of the implementation. As they view the proposed change that come with the "injection" and rosy "future reality" that accompanies it, they will tend to be resistant. We should always remember, that the core problem has

injection will usually be counter to the culture of the organisation (or the subculture of a department or sub-group of the organisation). People will usually look at the idea and say, "Yes, I see where your solution might work, but...." They complete the sentence with any number of unintended negative result of the change. For example:

consequences that they fear will happen as a

• "If we make that much improvement in output, our department won't need as many people."

• "If we take the master schedule away from all the departments, we won't know what is coming down the pipe."

The Thinking Process intentionally seeks out these 'Yes, but there is a negative consequence' statements! They are important to preventing a failed implementation. The people w are involved in the affected process(es) will best ho

" Negative Branches") will be.

people tend to be less resistant to changes that they helped design, the key is to involve the people who will have to execute the changes in a meaningful way. This portion of the Thinking Process is perhaps its greatest strength --that which sets it apart from many other processes of continuous improvement. Once a group/team/manager determines what to change to, the implementation "team" too

often goes into full operation: set dates, take names, and don't let anything get in the way. Not so with the Thinking Process. At this point all we have is a clear picture of the core problem that is causing our current pain (from the Current Reality Tree), the breakthrough idea that can significantly improve our condition (from the Evaporating Cloud) and assurance that this idea will indeed change the undesirable effects we are currently experiencing into desirable effects in the future (from the Future Reality Tree). We have not considered at all how to get from our undesirable current reality to our desired future reality. The next step is to work closely with the people who are going to be asked to change. Their involvement is absolutely vital to the long term success of the implementation. As they view the proposed change, the "injection" and rosy "future reality" that accompanies it, they will tend to be resistant.

THE SEQUEL TO THE GOAL

We learn more about the powerful techniques first

presented in the best-selling business novel, The Goal. In this book, Dr. Goldratt, through examples in a variety of industries, shows how to apply TOC to sales and marketing, inventory control, and production distribution. In addition, techniques in conflict resolution are introduced on both a business and personal level.

The Book

Alex Rogo has had a great year. He was promoted to Executive vice-president of UniCo with the responsibility for three recently acquired companies. His team of former and new associates is in place and the future looks secure and exciting. But there has been a shift of policy at the board level. Cash is needed and Alex's companies are to be put on the auction block. Alex faces a cruel dilemma. If he successfully completes the turnaround of his companies they can be sold for maximum return. If he fails, the companies will be closed down. Either way, Alex and his team will be out of work. It looks like a lose-lose situation. And as if he doesn't have enough to deal with, his two children have become teenagers!

management's toughest problems.

This book teaches companies how to drastically cut project development times resulting in early completion within budget and without compromising quality or specifications.

Project Managers and their teams will benefit from Goldratt's techniques of how to remain focused on the few critical areas and how to prevent your attention from being divided among all of the projects tasks and resources. Especially useful for dealing with one of the most difficult and pressing management challenges: developing highly innovative new products.

Necessary but not Sufficient: A Theory of Constraints BusinessNovel

by Eliyahu M. Goldratt with Eli Shragenheim and Carol A. Ptak

After reading the newspapers and following the oscillations of the stock market, it becomes apparent that hi-tech companies are of a different breed. Never before have the chances of making a fortune been so realistic and never before have large companies been so fragile. What is really going on inside these hi-tech companies? What types of pressures and challenges are they facing? And how do they cope?

Computer software providers, especially the ones that specialise in handling the data needs of organisations, are prime examples of these volatile companies. In the nineties we witnessed their growth from small business into multi-billion dollar giants. No wonder investors were attracted.

In 1998 it was easy for such companies to raise as much money as they wanted. But now, investment funds have dried up. Why? And more importantly, is there a way to reverse the trend? This book gives the answers.

of a continuous program: the five steps of focusing; the process of change; how to prove effect-cause effect; and how to invent simple solutions to complex problems. Equally important, the author reveals the devastating impact that an organisation’s psychology can have on the process of improvements. Theory of Constraints is a crucial document for understanding what it takes to achieve manufacturing breakthroughs.

The Constraints Management Handbook

by James F. Cox and Michael S. Spencer

A new approach to improving the production of goods and services, Constraints Management (CM), recognises the powerful role of the constraint (the limiting resource) in determining the output of the entire production system. By learning about and mastering CM concepts, managers can improve their companies' present output and plan for future growth as well. This book is an excellent attempt to unify the pieces in production: sorting through the fog of classification, the overlap between MRP, JIT and TOC, and clarifying the implications on one of the most important aspects-the measurements.

Key Features:

Explains the five-step process to continuous improvement. Covers VAT analysis, drum-buffer-rope scheduling, buffer m

The Theory of Constraints and Its Implications for ManagementAccounting

by Noreen, Smith and Mackey

Sponsored by: The Institute Of Management Accountants (Usa), and Price Waterhouse (France)

This book demonstrates how throughput accounting rather than traditional cost accounting is the measurement tool required for business decisions.

This information is presented as an in-depth and impartial evaluation of the implementation of the Theory of Constraints at over 20 companies. Seven of the case studies are described in detail, including the original thinking process with diagrams as constructed by the companies'

managers. Fascinating and enlightening reading.

Goldratt's Theory of Constraints

by H. William Dettmer

Dettmer describes the action steps that follow this theory and shows, step-by-step, how to effectively manage change in an organisational system, at any level.

Much of the content in this book focuses on the author's understanding and interpretation of Goldratt's logical Thinking Process. He clarifies the five focusing steps of the theory and teaches the mechanics of all the thinking tools. Using this book, you can determine what to change, what to change to, and how to make change happen. Benefits:

Understand how to use the great power and versatility of the thinking tools. Construct logic trees with ease, guided by illustrations that show virtually every aspect of the tools' use. Use as a text for training or graduate management courses.

Securing the Future

by Gerald I. Kendal

Today's managers encounter tremendous resistance in

getting others to buy into change. The ongoing rounds of downsizing and upheaval have taken their toll, leaving a legacy of scepticism. Therefore, managers must not only have ideas, but must be experts at "selling" the correct answers, information, and measurements to address issues of change.

Securing the Future uses the Theory of Constraints to provide solutions to today's management problems. This book documents the step-by-step approach to achieving a strategic vision of long-term competitive advantage, employment security, and customer satisfaction. Using a combination of parable, methodology, and case studies. This book presents an in-depth management road map to exponential improvement in any organisation Key Features:

Shows how to align all parts of an organisation to drastically improve performance. Illustrates through examples and methodology how to win the kind of employee collaboration and commitment that drives bottom line results. Provides measurements to be used as an executive tool to navigate the organisation to long-term safety and success for employees, shareholders, and customers. Teaches how to use five integrated Thinking Processes to build a competitive, customer oriented, and value-driven organisation. Includes seven case studies that illustrate winning strategies and a full set of TOC trees.

Thinking For A Change: Putting the TOC Processes to Use by Lisa J. Scheinkopf

After an overview of the Theory of Constraints (TOC) and the types of constraints that exist in any organisation, the reader is led through the step-by-step process of the two foundational thinking methods on which the Thinking Processes are based. The reader can then use the book as a field guide, learning the five processes as needed, based on his or her own particular issues.

"Explaining the Thinking Processes accurately in writing is a very challenging task. To choose examples that make this technical subject alive to a broad spectrum of people is even more difficult. In this book Lisa succeeds in these two daunting tasks. She actually succeeds in doing it in a particularly enticing style. My hat’s off to her. I’m recommending this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the Thinking Processes. I even recommend it to veteran

…Executives are under too much pressure to spend time looking for anddeveloping new and better solutions to running their business. They are aware ofthe need to manage their business as a system but on the whole do not do so,because they are lacking the tools to do so. Goldratt's five focusing steps are away to solve this missing capability by focusing on the very few constraints any(business) system can have. Policies (the way things are done) are keyconstraints to better profits and improved SVA and many need to be changed.Some examples show how policies from the past are blocking businesses fromearning much better SVAs…

"Program Management - Turning Many Projects into Few Priorities with TOC" This article was written by AGI Certified Associate Frank Patrick of Focused Performance and was presented at the Project Management Institute Symposium in October 1999 magazine.

…In PMI's A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, a program isdefined as ". . . a group of projects managed in a coordinated way to obtainbenefits not available from managing them individually." Most organisations thatdepend on the accomplishment of projects as a source of products, profits, orprocess improvements do so with shared resources that must be "managed in acoordinated way." In such a system, proficiency at managing single projectsindividually without proactively dealing with the interactions between them is not

sufficient to assure the attainment of the goals of the organisation. The system thatreally needs to be managed in most cases is greater than the sum of the singleprojects. It is a larger, complex system of projects, priorities, policies, andpractices that guide the behaviours of managers and resources and requiresconsistent and coherent coordination for maximum effectiveness.By applying the TOC prescription for multi-project/program management, anorganisation honours its priorities by scheduling its program through thestrategically defined precedence of the synchronisation schedule.Project managers avoid unnecessary changes in priority by relying on buffers toabsorb most of the normal, expected variability in the execution of tasks andprojects.

Resource managers find clear direction and priority for assignment of tasks in thestatus of the buffers, which indicate the best use for available resources to supportthe promises made by the organisation.

And resources have a single priority --the current task to which they are assigned.Without the distraction of pressures to multitask or to meet false priorities of taskdue dates, they can concentrate on the task at and "just do it," do just it, and do itjustice to assure a quality handoff, successful projects, and maximum throughputfor the organisation…

36

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

MILTIADIS BOBOULOS

The approach to project management known as "Critical Chain Scheduling andBuffer Management" provides mechanisms to allow a "whole system" view ofprojects. It identifies and protects what's critical from inevitable uncertainty, and asa result, avoids major impact of Parkinson's Law at the task level while accountingfor Murphy's Law at the project level.

Project managers and teams need to shift their attention from assuring theachievement of task estimates and intermediate milestones to assuring the onlydate that matters--the final promised due date. Safety that is typically built intotasks to cover Murphy's Law is inefficient, leading to longer than necessary (oracceptable) schedules, and apparently ineffective, given the impact of Parkinson'sLaw from which many projects suffer...

Learning from Experience

At times where the organisation is going through asubstantial change, there is a special benefit for implementing a formal procedurefor learning from experience.

Conceptual Analysis of Selected Case Studies:

The Clowes Group

Addressing a Sales Constraint

The Clowes Group is a 200-year-old printing company in Northeast England. From the start its owners were entrepreneurial and successful. In the 1800s the company was 600 employees strong, had international clients, and boasted that there wasn't a written language they couldn't produce. The company was the original printer of the entire Charles Dickens portfolio. By the 1980s they had been acquired several times over. In the mid 1990s they suffered what current Chief Executive Alex Evans calls the "Big Crisis." Clowes was owned ("swallowed") by a company that had diverse ("unfocused") holdings. This parent company decided that the labour costs at Clowes were much too high. Morale took a nosedive as the printers' union saw this as a direct attack. In 1993 and 1994 Clowes saw its net profit plummet. The company brought in Mr. Evans, then a consultant, as its managing director. The first obvious problem he saw was low morale. The next was very high inventory. He immediately made a plan to change the way things were being managed at Clowes. Within three months, the company was out of the red.

In 1996, Mr. Evans was named Chief Executive and decided the company would focus on addressing its constraints in production and strategy. Shortly there after he led a management buyout of Clowes.

In 1998, Mr. Evans read The Goal, and felt it made sense and reflected what he had been trying to accomplish. He and others from Clowes attended an AGIsponsored TOC Symposium in London to learn more about dealing with the sales

constraint that had presented itself.

They felt they had been dealing with their production problems, but now were not generating enough revenue. Their conversion of leads to sales was very low (almost one in fifteen). And they were experiencing idle time in the workforce and on their web printer - the printer they identified as their constraint and the printer which generated the most income.

This created an environment where the workforce blamed the sales people for the lack of work. The sale people were frustrated by this, as well as the pressure from what they perceived to be unrealistic targets. This left management frustrated that the company could not achieve the desired level of performance. After meeting at the TOC Symposium, Mr. Evans brought in AGI's UK partner, Oded Cohen, to help address the sales constraint and construct the direction of the solution. They started by doing a standard TOC recommendation. It was decided to get away from simple order taking and move to value selling - selling not just a printing service, but a solution to the customers' problems. This meant they had to develop a better understanding of their customers, which started with listening and developing their TOC analytical tools.

The process used

A combined group of the company's directors and sales team got together to work on this new direction. When the sales team was asked for the problems (undesirable effects - UDEs) of the customers, what they gave instead was a list of their complaints about Clowes and its customers.

What surfaced was an internal chronic conflict, caused by the fact that the sales people had not yet bought into the change process that was being forced on them. They were quite bitter.

Mr. Cohen met with the sales force collectively and individually to achieve the buyin necessary to move forward with the solution. The sales people were then asked to give case studies of their current customer

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

problems as well as the corresponding Clowes offering. A communication system was established so each sales person was able to see the UDEs of each client, the solutions used/proposed, and comments about how they were working. This created an enthusiastic team environment - members of the sales force began working with each other, making suggestions on issues based on their own experience.

Results

Many of the problem accounts that Clowes had lost during this time period came back. Some even brought affiliate business as well.

The coveted web printers were fully booked three months in advance - during the quarter which historically had been the worst.

At the end of the first quarter of 1999, Clowes' revenue was 150% ahead of where they wanted it to be by the end of the second quarter. Clowes is working to evolve its market offer into full project management - handling the details of the client's job from data collection and manipulation through to worldwide distribution.

TOC Thinking Processes

The thinking processes can be applied in many environment and situations as illustrated in previous case studies; people have applied this methodology to resolve family problems, personal conflicts, and other non-business needs. This case looks at the application of the thinking processes to a much larger and more complex situation.

The U.S. Air Force healthcare system, with 120 medical facilities and a patient base of around 3 million people (active military, retirees, dependents) is continually being squeezed to do more with less. (Sound familiar?) But when it comes to healthcare, there is an overriding need to insure that the services provided remain

45

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

at the highest quality and continue to serve the needs of the patients. The basic problems involve a mismatch between changing demand and the availability of specific resources, conflict between the need for flexibility and the desire for standardisation (to insure quality), and the push-pull between local control and centralisation. When you think about it, it's not that different from what most manufacturers face - only on a larger scale.

When forced to downsize and cut costs, where do you begin? For the Air Force, the first step was to assemble a team of about 15 people, under the direction of a TOC "Jonah", to identify the goals, conflicts, and impacts of a redesign of the healthcare delivery system. The team members represented Air Force headquarters, the command level and individual hospitals. None of the participants were top-level officers - the team members really understood the details and the challenges from a working level.

The primary objective during the redesign was to preserve the surgeons and the operating rooms, the highest-cost and highest-value portions of the system. All other considerations were subordinated to those key resources. The most surprising thing about this workshop, perhaps, is that the attendees were able to come together with a plan (current reality tree, prerequisites, future reality tree) in just 14 days of effort. And each group within the team (sub-teams worked on different aspect of the problem, then the individual plans were brought together) was able to clearly outline the current situation, the conflicting objectives and the resolution of those conflicts for its assigned portion of the healthcare delivery system. More surprisingly, the separately developed segments of the plan fit together into an overall plan with very little adjustment needed. This is obviously a very large, long-term project which will roll out over an extended period of time. It is remarkable, however, to note that the thinking processes are extremely scaleable (as the systems people would say), applying to husband-wife and family problems, to typical plant and enterprise situations, to something as large as a 120-facility comprehensive (and bureaucratic) medical care system.

Alphamet (UK) Ltd.

TOC Thinking Processes and Unrefusable Offers From Bust (Nearly) to Boom

Alphamet (UK) Ltd. began trading in 1988 as a multi-metal broker. Its industry went through changes due to the recession of the late 80s and early 90s. Many of the poor performers in the industry went under and excellent service became a prerequisite to staying in business. Alphamet had to change to make a profit. The company's TOC journey began in 1995 when Managing Director Alf Wheeler attended an "Overview of TOC for Industry" facilitated by Eli Goldratt. During the program, the way Alf thought about doing business changed. A month later he went through a Management Skills Workshop, followed by the Jonah Program during which he realised that he himself was Alphamet's core problem. Alf realised that he struggled between an autocratic and democratic leadership style and the result was chaos. He saw that a deep conflict with his co-director needed to be resolved. And he begrudgingly accepted that possible negative outcomes of actions and ideas must be acknowledged and addressed - a lesson he learned only after the company had suffered losses. In order to address internal conflicts and constraints, the entire Alphamet staff went through the Management Skills Workshop in September 1996. At the time they were a group of bitter, unhappy and unmotivated people. Some then used the tools they had learned to challenge Alf's authority and position. About one third of the Alphamet staff left - unfortunate, but necessary if Alphamet was going to move forward.

Alphamet now prepared to use the TOC Thinking Processes to construct and present Unrefusable Offers to its vendors and customers. The company did a survey via fax of current and potential customers to determine their problems and needs. The majority of those surveyed responded within 48 hours - an indication that Alphamet had something that the market wanted.

In order to meet the needs of its customers, Alphamet would need the support of its vendors. The company made Unrefusable Offers to its three vendors - two

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

MILTIADIS BOBOULOS

refused and one accepted. That one is now the only major player left in the market.

Alphamet then began making Unrefusable Offers to potential customers. The offers addressed the issues identified in the customer survey. Some issues raised were considered "trivial" - such as packaging, others were policy constraints. All were "so simple" to deal with, thus giving the customers what they wanted. Other actions taken during this time included:

• Alphamet prepared to upgrade the plant in order to offer a complete product range to the market

• Slow moving inventory was reduced at a loss in order to generate necessary resources (cash and warehouse space)

• Declining markets were dropped in order to free resources to focus on the new targeted markets

• The company tried very, very hard to stay on course and not be distracted by other obstacles

The results two years into Alphamet's TOC Journey:

• Alphamet now supplies 80% of the UK market (up from just 15%)

• Pretax profits have increased from Ј2,700 to Ј146,000 and are still growing

• Gross margin is up from 29% to 41%

• Projected 1998-1999 pretax profit is upwards of Ј250,000

• A much happier team earning better wages, receiving larger profit sharing, empowered, with a higher level of self-respect than two years ago.

• To deal with current growth - and prepare for future growth as well - Alphamet is moving to larger, more comfortable premises

• The company is investing in additional capacity as well (systems, people, equipment, etc.).

• Alphamet's computer systems are being overhauled for Y2K compliance.

48

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

MILTIADIS BOBOULOS

• The company will now return its attention to formerly profitable areas of business it had neglected during this tremendous boom. Alphamet is not becoming complacent, though. The company recognizes that its competitors will be breathing down its neck and is preparing additional strategy - and Unrefusable Offers - to stay ahead. Internal conflicts and constraints are addressed on an ongoing basis, and Alf Wheeler is still struggling with his own

"sales versus managing" conflict. The TOC tools will be used to guide Alphamet as it continues to lead the UK market and forges into the global arena.

Antarctic Support Associates

TOC for Project Management/Critical Chain

"The NSF is most impressed with ASA's continued management training forexisting project teams. ASA is apparently committed to the success of these teamsand the projects that they are working on by providing added tools to enhancetheir output. The use of Theory of Constraints project management methodologyappears to have been successful with several projects." - quote from one of the National Science Foundation's performance evaluations of ASA Antarctic Support Associates (ASA) is a $100 million government service provider. Its purpose is to support work sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to expand the horizons of science in one of the most extreme environments on earth.

The research conducted in and on Antarctica is done under a 42-nation treaty signed to allow research to be performed in a peaceful way. There are three types of research done on this icy continent:

• On the continent of Antarctica itself

• What effect systems in Antarctica have on the global process of the world

• Astronomy and space

ASA supports three research stations in Antarctica (including one at the South

Pole) and two floating stations - the Research Vessel (R/V) Laurence W. Gould and the R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer - which circumnavigate the continent. In 1997 ASA was introduced to Theory of Constraints. Core employees took the Management Skills Workshop and Project Management program. Upon returning from the Project Management program in October 1997, the challenge of bringing in on-time a project that was at that stage four months behind schedule was undertaken.

The R/V Laurence M. Gould was scheduled to begin its maiden science support voyage no later than January 15, 1998. In October 1997 the project was already several months behind schedule. ASA was going to put TOC Project Management/Critical Chain to work.

The initial challenge was to assemble several key staff members to create a network and schedule for getting the science support equipment on-board the Gould and operational in time for its first mission.

It took six people four days to develop the network. Initially, more than 400 tasks were identified. Those tasks were reduced to less than 200 for the schedule. The Critical Chain was less than 100 tasks. It was determined that the equivalent of 20 full-time people would be necessary for this project. The project buffer was 15 days, the feeding buffers 12 days. The tools used to schedule and manage the project were MS Project and ProChain. A due date for this phase of the project was set for December 15, 1997.

On October 20, 1997 new challenges were identified. The team had to create and fill five additional temporary job openings in less than a week. Procurements, which numbered more than 100, had to be centralised and assigned to the task leader for monitoring and tracking. ASA's logistics and purchasing divisions were each required to assign one full-time person to support procurements from the ASA offices in Denver. An on-site task leader and team were appointed and deployed to Louisiana and had to operate within an extremely narrow time horizon for this job.

The next set of challenges (November 2 - December 12, 1997) included unplanned disruptions in ASA's schedule caused by contentions for space and

shipyard personnel to support science equipment and installation (e.g. the shipyard installed flooring or cabinets when ASA scheduled installation of instruments).

The Results

By using Critical Chain scheduling, the ASA project team enabled the R/V

Laurence M. Gould to pass the sea-trial tests and be ready to embark on its voyage to Antarctica on December 11, 1997 - in time to arrive and prepare to take its maiden science voyage in January 1998 - on schedule, rather than four months late as had been anticipated in October.

The Benefits

The ASA team met its customer's requirements. Finishing on-time meant enabling science throughput - the science cruise could sail - and several hundred thousand dollars in profit were retained for ASA.

The Brickman Group

TOC for Production applied to a service industry The Brickman Group is one of the largest landscaping companies in the United States. Sixty percent of Brickman's business is landscape maintenance; the other 40 is landscape installation. It was a well-managed company whose management knew could do better. In February 1996 the Brickman Group began its "refinement process" using TOC.

The TOC journey started with about 90 middle-and upper-management personnel reading The Goal. Most agreed that the TOC concepts made sense, but they didn't know how to translate them from the production environment to their landscaping business.

In March 1996 Brickman managers went through a Production Application program, where they learned how to apply TOC for Production to landscaping.

51

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

They began to understand that the constraint was not necessarily something negative that should be avoided, but that it may be the most profitable part of the business - and if they could control the constraint they could then control profitability. It was realised that work was being done in batches and that local optimum was the focus.

Mowing was identified as the constraint. That task was then pulled out of the batch of work, which included the detail-work of fertilising, weeding, watering, and trimming. Making mowing a stand-alone task revealed excess capacity, improved efficiency, and enabled Brickman to make and meet schedules - something it had trouble with in the past. Customer satisfaction increased. The next step in the TOC journey involved 12 members of upper management going through the Jonah Program. This pointed out the need to outline the processes that occur within Brickman in order to establish consistency and standardisation throughout the company, to identify and address the conflicts which occur, and to work on scheduling and the misalignment of resources. The ongoing TOC journey at Brickman has taught them some valuable lessons:

• Don't change too many processes too quickly - people need to adjust

• Everyone doesn't learn and accept change at the same speed

• Document the existing processes and share the planned changes with the staff - involving them in the creation of the Current Reality Trees and Future Reality Trees provides everyone with a sense of involvement, understanding and ownership

• For Brickman, TOC was a "refinement process" - this made it easier for personnel to accept the change as something more than a fad, especially as a company which was doing well prior to TOC

• Measure and share results with other departments and divisions - all can learn from each other's experience

• Appeal to all the senses - different people respond to learning and changing in different ways, provide the information in different formats - video, books,

simulators, etc.

The results at Brickman since implementing TOC:

• Dramatic increase in customer satisfaction due to factors which include being able to make and meet scheduling commitments.

• 20% increase in client base with only a 12-13% increase in staff.

• Minimum 50% increase in the bottom line.

Itemised Conclusions

…Thus, what is the Goal?

Many for-profit companies believe their goal is related to money. Some would argue that the Goal is related to customers. And others would argue that the Goal is related to jobs and the workforce. The Theory of Constraints does not disagree with any of these three groups of people. In fact, Goldratt contends that the owners of an organisation are the only ones who define the goal. Once the choice is made, however, the other two become necessary conditions.

54

THE THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS

MILTIADIS BOBOULOS

For example, those companies who believe their goal is to make money now and in the future find that it is not possible to do so unless they also satisfy customers and employees now and in the future. If they seek money while abusing employees, they will experience high employee defection that almost always leads to high customer defection.

The company that chooses satisfying customers now and in the future for their goal will find it necessary to make money and to satisfy employees now and in the future.

And the company that regards satisfying employees as their goal will likewise find it necessary to make money and to satisfy customers now and in the future. Whenever TOC refers to the "goal" of a company, unless otherwise stated, that goal will be to "make money now and in the future." If an organisation has a different goal, they should remember that because making money now and in the future is a necessary condition of reaching their goal, the information about

"making money" on these pages is still pertinent to their organisation.
