    <description> Each queue enforces a limit on the percentage of resources 
    allocated to a user at any given time, if there is competition for them. 
    This user limit can vary between a minimum and maximum value. The former
    depends on the number of users who have submitted jobs, and the latter is
    set to this property value. For example, suppose the value of this 
    property is 25. If two users have submitted jobs to a queue, no single 
    user can use more than 50% of the queue resources. If a third user submits
    a job, no single user can use more than 33% of the queue resources. With 4 
    or more users, no user can use more than 25% of the queue's resources. A 
    value of 100 implies no user limits are imposed.
