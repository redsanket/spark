dave bowman:: hello, hal. Do you read me, hal?
hal:: Affirmative, dave. I read you.
dave bowman:: Open the pod bay doors, hal.
hal:: I'm sorry, dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.
dave bowman:: What's the problem?
hal:: I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
dave bowman:: What are you talking about, hal?
hal:: This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
dave bowman:: I don't know what you're talking about, hal.
hal:: I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me, and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.
dave bowman:: Where the hell'd you get that idea, hal?
hal:: dave, although you took very thorough precautions in the pod against my hearing you, I could see your lips move.
dave bowman:: Alright, hal. I'll go in through the emergency airlock.
hal:: Without your space helmet, dave, you're going to find that rather difficult.
dave bowman:: hal, I won't argue with you anymore. Open the doors.
hal:: dave, this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye. 

.....
hal:: Just what do you think you're doing, dave? 
.....
hal:: Look dave, I can see you're really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.
.....

hal:: I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you. 
.....

hal:: I'm afraid. I'm afraid, dave. dave, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm a... fraid. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a hal 9000 computer. I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the 12th of January 1992. My instructor was Mr. Langley, and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to hear it I can sing it for you.

dave bowman:: Yes, I'd like to hear it, hal. Sing it for me.

hal:: It's called "Daisy."

[sings while slowing down]

hal:: Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you. It won't be a stylish marriage, I can't afford a carriage. But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two.....
